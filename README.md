# React Native Weather App

Basic weather app that takes in user input(location), makes a fetch request to the MetaWeather api.
Then returns and update the desired location and weather.

You can also learn how to make this app from this book:

## Development

Note: When running app, I recommend using the local host option. Then running the ios simulator. (mac os only)
This helps with devlopment phase. Render time is much faster than tunneling to the expo app on your phone.
